# Project Dashboard
My personal projects, displayed all within the same site using `<iframe>` functionality for purposes of demonstrating to employers/clients my web development portfolio without pasting a list of links in an email and requriring them to navigate to these sites one by one without any explanation as to what the site is and why I wrote it. 

The project dashboard enables me to write up a quick Markdown file that Next.js will render into a static page, with links to the site and its Github I provide in the frontmatter, and demonstrate the site on that very page. 

`It's a pretty slick system` if I may say so myself, inspired by [demolab](https://github.com/atapas/demolab) but written from scratch using Next.js instead of Gatsby to take advantage of the performance benefits and better developer experience offered by Next.js (not to mention its superb integration with the Vercel platform that remains my preferred JAMstack host even with the strides Netlify has been making recently).
